Face Verification Module - DISABLED

This module has been disabled due to Python 3.13 compatibility issues with numpy/opencv/deepface.
All face verification functions return successful results as placeholders.

To re-enable: Install Python 3.11 and uncomment dependencies in requirements-windows.txt
